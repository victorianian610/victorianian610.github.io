Hello! I’m Yuhan (Victoria) Nian, a senior at 
<a href="https://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>, 
pursuing a 
<a href="https://ga.rice.edu/programs-study/departments-programs/engineering/statistics/statistics-bs/">B.S. in Statistics</a> 
(with a 
<a href="https://ga.rice.edu/programs-study/departments-programs/engineering/data-science/data-science-minor/">minor in Data Science</a>) 
and a 
<a href="https://ga.rice.edu/programs-study/departments-programs/humanities/asian-studies/asian-studies-ba-asian-language-concentration/">B.A. in Asian Studies</a>. You can find my upper-division coursework <a href="coursework.html"><u>here</u></a>.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in uncertainty quantification, bayesian inference, trustworthy machine learning, and causal inference, with applications in biostatistics, computational social science, and natural language processing.

## Beyond Statistics

In parallel with my quantitative work, I study East Asian culture as part of my Asian Studies major. I’m particularly interested in how technology, society, and language intersect—both in academic research and everyday life. Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, traveling, and exploring new perspectives through language learning.
