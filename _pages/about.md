# Welcome

Hello! Iâ€™m **Yuhan (Victoria) Nian**, a senior at **Rice University**, pursuing a **B.S. in Statistics** (with a minor in Data Science) and a **B.A. in Asian Studies**.  
My work bridges statistical theory, computation, and interdisciplinary researchâ€”spanning both quantitative modeling and cultural inquiry.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in **uncertainty quantification**, **Bayesian inference**, **trustworthy machine learning**, and **causal inference**, with applications in **biostatistics**, **computational social science**, **applied statistics**, and **natural language processing**.

I am passionate about developing interpretable and reliable statistical tools that enhance decision-making in domains ranging from health sciences to text-based social data. My projects often combine theoretical analysis, data-driven modeling, and open-source software development.

## Beyond Statistics

In parallel with my quantitative work, I study East Asian culture as part of my Asian Studies major. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how technology, society, and language intersectâ€”both in academic research and everyday life.

Outside of academics, I enjoy **photography**, **traveling**, and exploring new perspectives through language learning.
