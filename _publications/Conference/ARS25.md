This presentation introduced a computational framework for mapping cultural schemas in dementia narratives using semantic network analysis.  
We combined qualitative coding with text embedding–based similarity mapping to visualize how individuals and caregivers construct meaning through discourse. The study demonstrates how sociocultural structures shape experiences of illness and caregiving, revealing both common and divergent sensemaking patterns across interview contexts.
